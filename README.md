# Excercio-AI
EXERCEO-AI is an AI-powered system designed to recognize and evaluate physical exercises using computer vision techniques. By leveraging pose estimation and machine learning algorithms, it aims to provide real-time feedback on exercise form and performance.

# Features
    Pose Estimation: Utilizes advanced computer vision models to detect and analyze human body keypoints during exercise.

    Exercise Classification: Identifies various types of exercises based on movement patterns.

    Performance Evaluation: Assesses the correctness and quality of exercise execution, offering feedback for improvement.

    Real-time Analysis: Processes live video feeds to provide immediate insights.
