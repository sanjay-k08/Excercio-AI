      "Planner Agent Response: To achieve your goal of losing weight and building stamina, it is important to incorporate a combination of cardiovascular exercise and strength training into your workout routine. Here is a structured workout plan that you can follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Warm-up: Start with a 5-10 minute dynamic warm-up to prepare your muscles for exercise. This can include exercises such as jumping jacks, high knees, and arm circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cardiovascular exercise: Perform 30-45 minutes of moderate to high-intensity cardio exercise at least 3-4 times per week. This can include activities such as running, cycling, swimming, or using the elliptical machine. Aim to gradually increase the intensity and duration of your cardio workouts over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Strength training: Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine 2-3 times per week. Focus on full-body exercises that target multiple muscle groups, such as squats, lunges, push-ups, and rows. Aim to perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. HIIT workouts: Include high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts into your routine 1-2 times per week. These workouts involve alternating between short bursts of intense exercise and periods of rest or lower intensity exercise. This can help improve your cardiovascular fitness and burn more calories in a shorter amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Cool down: Finish your workout with a 5-10 minute cool down to help your heart rate return to normal and prevent muscle soreness. This can include stretching exercises for all major muscle groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Rest and recovery: Make sure to allow your body time to rest and recover between workouts. Aim for at least 1-2 rest days per week to prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to also focus on maintaining a healthy and balanced diet to support your weight loss goals. Consistency and dedication to your workout plan will help you achieve your desired results.\n"
